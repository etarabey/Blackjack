This is a program that simulates a game of single player blackjack. 
Note 1: You could only split once in the game. 
Note 2: I have written this code for my 11th grade coding class (Introductory coding class), and that is why there is so many lines of code. Since then, I have improved my coding in Python and I could see that I could have used some other efficient ways to code this in Python, such as having the use of classes and module files for the split option or even the entities in the game.
